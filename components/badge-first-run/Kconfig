    bool "debug -- basvs broken badge"

    help
        One of my badges has a non-functioning SELECT button.
        Am using this config-option to avoid building final images
        with workarounds for it.

        You probably don't want this, unless you're using my badge.

config ALLOW_BATTERY_FIRST_BOOT
    bool "Allow battery present during first boot sequence"
    default n
    help
        If enabled the first run will not stop when battery voltage is detected, useful for developing
